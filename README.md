The entire site is created with Oxygen, a Builder-type plugin that allows faster development of the web interface, custom styles can be integrated through a style sheet or selectors. It also allows adding javascript with jquery or vanilla

Use the Advanced Custom Fields and Custom Post Types plugins with the intention of generating custom modules to manage website content. I also used the Fluent Forms plugin to be able to integrate the form and capture the leads in the administration panel and save them in the database.

The entire website is dynamically created to make it easy to manage and update.
